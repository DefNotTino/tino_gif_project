			<p class="paragraphs"> The origins of GIF started in the late 1980s when Computer Software Developer Steve Wilhite and his team CompuServe were experimenting with new innovative technological goals. The goal they were tasked with was, how could they make a computer display images while also saving computer memory (RAM)? They also took into consideration other vital factors such as color images that take up more memory in comparison to black and white photos. 	What Wilhite discovered was that he could create a computer algorithm that compressed images along with their colors into a single file format. The file format he created was GIF (Graphics Interchange Format).</p>

		<h2> 1990s: The Creation of Animated GIFS </h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> During the 1990s with the rise of the internet, GIFS were still only used as still images. Most of them are just compressed images on computers. It wasnâ€™t until Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, and Terry Welch discovered Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), another image format that compressed multiple images into a single animated format. They would create patterns of multiple images, similar to that of a flipbook animation, and create small image clips. The first example that was created was an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1470412914553365" target="_blank"> weather map</a>. Images during the 90s were still extremely scarce, with the first image posted on the internet being a still GIF image. Most of the GIFS created during this time were being used without even mentioning the team that invented it, CompuServe. </p> 
		<br>
			<p class="paragraphs">Later in the 1990s, the developers of the LZW would be under copyright claims from a company called Unisys Corporation. They claimed that they owned the patent for GIFS and wanted their cut of the success that GIF was getting. In response, developers created a new file format named PNG which was similar to GIF, but had more technological advances and was free of the patent claim from Unisys Corp. Technologically speaking, PNG held more color information and data than GIF could. In 2004, Unisys Corp would lose the patent for GIF. </p>

		<h2> 2000s: Rise of Social Media </h2>
			<p class="paragraphs"> During the late 1990s to around the early 2000s, GIFs were becoming obsolete. No one really used the file format when it came to static images. So what about the animated images that we know today that LZW created? Well, it turns out that due to the patent from Unisys Corp, it never became popular since they branched off from the GIF format and created PNG.  During this period, websites used very early versions of HTML, and GIF images were mainly used on websites to show that they were under construction or maintenance.
		<br>
		<p class="paragraphs">Early GIFS during this time had simple a few keyframe animations. This was to demonstrate the transitions between various images. These animations were very quick and were rarely used outside of just websites. Computer software also used gifs to animate loading screens or wait times. An example of this is the animation in early versions of Windows OS when a user would connect to the internet via Dial-Up.</p> 
		<br>
		<p class="paragraphs">The mid-2000s sought the early rise of social media. The first popular version of social media was a website named MySpace. It was a social media platform where people could communicate and interact by hosting online profiles. It contained a user's likes, preferences, hobbies, and more. One way that users could customize their profile was to share images of the things they liked to do. From personal experience, I was in my early teens when MySpace was popular. I interacted with my friends about anime and sports using animated GIFS. These gifs were just simple pictures that showed my favorite anime characters.
		As social media evolved, so did GIFS. The file format sought a huge resurgence thanks to social media, internet culture, and technological advancements. Internet culture (aka. Meme culture) would use GIFS to prank friends or for other comedic purposes. Social media saw an expansion of the format where Facebook became the first social media platform to implement GIFS built into their software. Technology would advance GIFS to allow multiple frame gifs where it would essentially be mini video clips. All of these factors would make GIFS become a very popular file format once again. </p>

		<h2> Present: GIFS as Reactions </h2>
		<p class="paragraphs">Today, GIFS are used in many various ways. They are now built into multiple software such as texting keyboards, emojis, etc. The only thing that has changed is that GIFS are now typically used to express a person's emotions or reactions. They usually refer to pop culture, films, and media clips in a short GIF animation as responses. With the massive rise of the internet culture came along the remarkable rise of the GIF format. GIF has seen its rise and fall in history, but it is the one file format that has a massive impact on the way we view images today.</p>
